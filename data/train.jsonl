The troubleshooting process can require a packet capture of network traffic to analyze the root cause. Cable integrity is important to supply Power over Ethernet (PoE) and data to a camera. Cable termination, interconnects, distance, and bends must all be considered. Power budgeting Each camera requires PoE power to function. Make sure your network switch has enough PoE power to support all of the connected cameras at full power draw. Cameras use less power during the day. When cameras switch to night mode, the IR emitters activate to illuminate the scene for better visibility. The infrared (IR) emitters increase power draw. If multiple cameras are connected to the same PoE switch, the PoE draw can increase significantly at night. If the switch does not have enough power to deliver to all the cameras, some", "id": "898dec82-4dbe-4737-992b-dd99743f2249", "question": "What is the maximum storage capacity of the MP1 WDR Lens?", "title": "https://help.verkada.com/en/articles/5714738-camera-deployment", "index": 41}

AI-powered reverse image analysis pulls multiple aspects of an uploaded image, like shapes, pixels, patterns, and other granular details, then delivers the most reasonable matches from one's footage. 3. Results leverage hyperzooms, which are highly-detailed segments of a video frame that contain images of a person or a vehicle only, typically the most important parts of an investigation. If an uploaded image does not include a person or vehicle (i.e., a standalone object), results will be directed to hyperzooms of people and vehicles that include the object (e.g., if uploading a standalone suitcase, the search will return results of a person holding a suitcase or a suitcase attached to a vehicle).

Check for moving objects in the camera's field of view Frequently moving objects (e.g. balloons, flags, digital signage) may cause the camera to falsely detect a person. We recommend removing these types of objects from the field of view of any camera being used as an alarm trigger. Check for nearby reflections Cameras that are facing windows or other reflective surfaces may falsely detect people in areas where they are not. This can often be resolved by setting up line crossing as an alarm trigger, rather than detecting a person anywhere in the camera's field of view. You may also set up a region of interest that does not include the reflective surface.
