Make sure your network switch has enough PoE power to support all of the connected cameras at full power draw. Cameras use less power during the day. When cameras switch to night mode, the IR emitters activate to illuminate the scene for better visibility. The infrared (IR) emitters increase power draw. If multiple cameras are connected to the same PoE switch, the PoE draw can increase significantly at night. If the switch does not have enough power to deliver to all the cameras, somespace.

If multiple cameras are connected to the same PoE switch, the PoE draw can increase significantly at night. If the switch does not have enough power to deliver to all the cameras, some cameras go offline. To determine if your switch does not have enough power, your cameras will go offline each night around the same time as other cameras on the same switch when entering into night mode. An easy way to spec power on a switch is to multiply the number of cameras connected by 30W, which is the maximum power delivered by PoE+. For example, if you had 10 cameras, you would calculate like this: 10 cameras X 30W = 300W PoE budget on the switch See the camera-model-specific data sheet to learn about the full power draw.

For example, if you leverage PBR to only forward client VLAN traffic to Zscaler, instead of using a default route to pass the traffic along the GRE/IPSec tunnel to the Zscaler DC, then there is scope to adjust the routing. This means that if the Verkada cameras are on a dedicated VLAN, you can configure the network to forward traffic from this VLAN out to the internet through normal means while still having client-based VLANs forwarded on to to Zscaler, as shown below Topology example Zscaler features to consider Zscaler has a number of additional features that you can leverage.
