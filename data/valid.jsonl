On the other hand, the lower the altitude, the higher the barometric pressure.

The goal of BACnet is to enable efficient and standardized communication between different building automation devices, promoting interoperability, scalability, and flexibility in the design and operation of building control systems. Benefits of BACnet Here are some instances where the intuitiveness of BACnet can be beneficial to your organization: Adjusts the temperature in a room or building to save costs Adjusts the output of dampers to increase fresh air circulation in a room Turns on supply fans Automatically closes windows when poor air quality is detected Automatically turns on air filtration systems and increases outdoor airflow when the CO2 levels are high Only runs air through filtration systems when pollution thresholds are met, to avoid unnecessary filtration when the air is clean Automatically increases the ventilation rate in a lab when there are high levels of VOCs Use", "id": "f07764af-fc01-409c-ad74-60005d5ac4d6", "question": "What is the goal of BACnet?", "title": "https://help.verkada.com/en/articles/7984822-bacnet-for-verkada-air-quality-sensors#h_a35774375e", "index": 718}

By integrating Verkada's sensors with this protocol, your organization's HVAC systems can now automatically respond to suboptimal air conditions. Learn more about BACnet for Verkada Air Quality Sensors. To use this integration, your building must have a Building Automation System (BAS) that is compatible with BACnet IP. We recommend that you contact your HVAC specialist to understand if your system is supported. If you are unsure or need help, contact Verkada Support.
